STOP - The Real Issue is Module Import Resolution, Not Docker Cache
You're focusing on the wrong problem. The issue isn't Docker cache or build processes - it's static ES module imports being resolved at runtime in production.
The Core Problem
When Node.js loads your compiled index.js, it tries to resolve ALL imports at the top of modules, even if they're in conditional code paths that won't execute. Your server/vite.ts file has:
typescriptimport { createServer as createViteServer, createLogger } from "vite";
This import gets resolved when the module loads, before any conditional logic runs.
The ONLY Solution That Will Work
Replace static imports with dynamic imports in server/vite.ts:
typescript// REMOVE these static imports from the top:
// import { createServer as createViteServer, createLogger } from "vite";
// import viteConfig from "../vite.config";

export async function setupVite(app: Express, server: Server) {
  // ADD dynamic imports inside the function:
  const { createServer: createViteServer, createLogger } = await import("vite");
  const viteConfig = await import("../vite.config");
  
  const viteLogger = createLogger();
  // ... rest of function unchanged
}
Alternative: Separate Development/Production Files
Create two separate entry points:

server/index.dev.ts - imports vite.ts for development
server/index.prod.ts - only static file serving, no Vite imports

Why Your Current Approaches Won't Work

Docker cache clearing - Irrelevant to import resolution
Separate production.ts - Good idea, but you're still importing the file with Vite dependencies
Build process changes - The issue happens at runtime, not build time

Immediate Action Required

Edit server/vite.ts to use dynamic imports as shown above
OR create a production-only entry point that doesn't import vite.ts at all
Stop focusing on Docker/build issues - this is a Node.js module resolution issue

The static import resolution happens before your conditional logic, which is why all your other fixes aren't working.
