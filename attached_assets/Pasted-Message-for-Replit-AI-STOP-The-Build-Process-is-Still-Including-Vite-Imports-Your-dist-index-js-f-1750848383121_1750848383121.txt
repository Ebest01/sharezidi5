STOP - The Build Process is Still Including Vite Imports
Your dist/index.js file literally contains a Vite import statement. All the dynamic import fixes didn't work because the build process is still creating a file with static Vite imports.
IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - 3 Options
Option 1: Quick Fix (Install Vite in Production)
bashnpm install vite --save
This will fix the error immediately, though it's not ideal.
Option 2: Examine the Compiled File
Look at what's actually in dist/index.js:
bashhead -50 dist/index.js
# or
grep -n "vite" dist/index.js
This will show you exactly where the Vite import is coming from.
Option 3: Complete Separation (Recommended)
Create a brand new production server with ZERO connection to the existing files:
Create server/prod-server.ts:
typescriptimport express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";
import { createServer } from "http";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

const httpServer = createServer(app);

// Basic WebSocket setup (copy from routes.ts but simplified)
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: httpServer, path: '/ws' });

// Serve static files
const publicPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "public");
app.use(express.static(publicPath));
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(publicPath, "index.html"));
});

const port = 5000;
httpServer.listen({ port, host: "0.0.0.0" }, () => {
  console.log(`Production server running on port ${port}`);
});
Update package.json:
json{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/prod-server.js"
  }
}
Update Dockerfile:
dockerfileRUN npx esbuild server/prod-server.ts --bundle --platform=node --outfile=dist/prod-server.js --external:ws
Why This Keeps Happening
Your build tool is following the import chain and bundling Vite even when you think you've removed it. The only way to guarantee success is to create a production entry point that has absolutely zero connection to any file that imports Vite.
The Root Cause
Somewhere in your import chain (index.ts → vite.ts → Vite), the bundler is still including Vite. Dynamic imports may not work if the bundler is resolving them at build time.
Try Option 1 for a quick fix, but implement Option 3 for the proper solution.
