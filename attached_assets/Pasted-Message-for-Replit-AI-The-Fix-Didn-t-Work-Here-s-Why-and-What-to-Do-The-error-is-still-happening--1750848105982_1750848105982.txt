The Fix Didn't Work - Here's Why and What to Do
The error is still happening because your compiled dist/index.js still contains a static Vite import. The dynamic import approach failed for one of these reasons:
Possible Issues:

TypeScript/Build tool compiled dynamic imports to static imports
Another file still has static Vite imports
The vite.ts file is still being imported statically somewhere
Build cache isn't cleared

GUARANTEED SOLUTION - Complete Elimination
Step 1: Find ALL Vite imports
bash# Search for ANY Vite imports in your source code
grep -r "from.*vite" server/
grep -r "import.*vite" server/
Step 2: Create a completely separate production entry point
Create server/production.ts with ZERO Vite dependencies:
typescriptimport express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { registerRoutes } from "./routes";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// Add your logging middleware here (copy from index.ts)

async function startServer() {
  const server = await registerRoutes(app);
  
  // Error handler
  app.use((err: any, _req: any, res: any, _next: any) => {
    const status = err.status || err.statusCode || 500;
    const message = err.message || "Internal Server Error";
    res.status(status).json({ message });
    throw err;
  });

  // ONLY serve static files - NO VITE IMPORTS AT ALL
  const publicPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "public");
  app.use(express.static(publicPath));
  app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(publicPath, "index.html"));
  });

  const port = 5000;
  server.listen({ port, host: "0.0.0.0" }, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
  });
}

startServer().catch(console.error);
Step 3: Update package.json
json{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/production.js"
  }
}
Step 4: Update Dockerfile
dockerfile# Build the production server (NOT index.ts)
RUN npx esbuild server/production.ts --bundle --platform=node --outfile=dist/production.js --external:ws --external:express
The Key Point
NEVER import vite.ts or any file that imports Vite in your production entry point. Create a completely separate production server file that has zero connection to Vite.
Your current approach still has some connection to Vite imports somewhere in the dependency chain. The only way to guarantee this works is complete separation.
