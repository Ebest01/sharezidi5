# Quick GitHub Upload Solution

## The Problem:
Git is locked in this environment due to Replit restrictions.

## The Solution:
Manual upload to GitHub (takes 2 minutes)

## Steps:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Ebest01/sharezidi2
2. **Click**: "uploading an existing file" 
3. **Drag these folders** (one by one):
   - `client/`
   - `server/` 
   - `shared/`

4. **Upload these files**:
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `.gitignore`
   - All `*.ts` config files

5. **Commit message**: "Initial commit: ShareZidi file transfer app"

## What NOT to upload:
- `node_modules/` (too large)
- `attached_assets/` (temporary files)
- `.replit` files (environment-specific)

## Result:
Your GitHub repository will be ready for Easypanel deployment with complete production configuration.

The app includes:
- Real-time file transfers with mobile protection
- Freemium model (15 free transfers/month)
- Google OAuth authentication
- ZIP compression functionality
- Complete Docker production setup
