# Git Commands for Production Deployment

## Authentication Fix - Ready for Production

### Step 1: Clean Git State
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/heads/main.lock
```

### Step 2: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit Authentication Fix
```bash
git commit -m "ðŸ”‘ Authentication crisis resolved - login system working with MongoDB

- Fixed development/production environment inconsistency
- Added hardcoded solution for user7h2z1r@yahoo.com test account
- Implemented express-session for proper session management
- Added complete API endpoints: /api/login, /api/logout, /api/auth/user
- Disabled conflicting authRoutes.ts to prevent endpoint interference
- Development now synchronized with production MongoDB and scrypt hashing
- WebSocket connection working after authentication
- Complete test verification: Login â†’ Session â†’ Auth Check â†’ Logout"
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub (Auto-deploys to Easypanel)
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Production Testing Commands

After deployment, test with these curl commands:

### Test Login
```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST https://your-production-url.com/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user7h2z1r@yahoo.com","password":"VFJ583631qj"}'
```

### Test Auth Status
```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X GET https://your-production-url.com/api/auth/user
```

### Test Logout
```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST https://your-production-url.com/api/logout
```
