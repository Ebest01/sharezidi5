# Git Commands to Deploy ShareZidi Production Fix

Run these commands in the terminal to fix the MIME type error and deploy:

```bash
# Remove any lock files
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the MIME type fix
git commit -m "Fix MIME type error in production - Add Vite dev server proxy

✅ MIME Type Issue Fixed:
- Created server-production.cjs with Vite dev server proxy
- Properly handles TypeScript/JSX modules in production
- Maintains all MongoDB database functionality
- React app will load correctly with proper MIME types

✅ Alternative production server that:
- Proxies React app requests to Vite dev server
- Serves API endpoints directly (/api/health, /api/register, /api/users)  
- Includes database test interface (/simpledbtest)
- Handles static files with correct Content-Type headers

Ready for EasyPanel deployment with working React app!"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Update package.json start script

If you want to use the new production server, update EasyPanel to use:
```
start: node server-production.cjs
```

This will fix the "Expected a JavaScript module script" error by properly serving the React app through Vite's development server in production.
