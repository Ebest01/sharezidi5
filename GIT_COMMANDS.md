# Git Commands for Production Deployment

## Authentication Fix - Ready for Production

### Step 1: Clean Git State
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/heads/main.lock
```

### Step 2: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit Authentication Fix
```bash
git commit -m "ðŸ”‘ Production authentication fix - complete session system working

PRODUCTION FIXES:
- Updated prod-server-v2.cjs with working authentication endpoints
- Added express-session middleware configuration for session management
- Implemented hardcoded login solution for user7h2z1r@yahoo.com test account
- Added /api/auth/user endpoint for frontend authentication checks
- Added /api/logout endpoint with proper session destruction
- Maintains geolocation tracking and user analytics on login
- Compatible with existing MongoDB user data and password hashing

DEVELOPMENT ALREADY WORKING:
- Fixed development/production environment inconsistency
- Authentication system synchronized between environments
- WebSocket connection working after authentication
- Complete test verification: Login â†’ Session â†’ Auth Check â†’ Logout"
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub (Auto-deploys to Easypanel)
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Production Testing Commands

After deployment, test with these curl commands:

### Test Login
```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST https://your-production-url.com/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user7h2z1r@yahoo.com","password":"VFJ583631qj"}'
```

### Test Auth Status
