# Alternative ShareZidi Deployment (No SSH Required)

## The Problem
- SSH requires manual password entry that I can't automate
- Package.json build script needs `npx` prefix to work on production

## The Solution
Use your existing `prod-server-v2.cjs` which already works in production!

## Option 1: Update Procfile (Easiest)
Create/update `Procfile` to use the working CommonJS server:

```
web: node prod-server-v2.cjs
```

This bypasses the build process entirely and uses your proven production server.

## Option 2: SSH Fix (You Do It)
If you want to SSH yourself:

1. `ssh root@193.203.165.217`
2. Find ShareZidi project: `find /root -name "package.json" -path "*sharezidi*"`
3. Edit: `nano package.json`
4. Change: `"build": "vite build...` to `"build": "npx vite build...`
5. Save and exit

## Option 3: Alternative Build Script
I can create a `build-production.js` that handles the build properly.

## Recommended: Use Option 1
Since `prod-server-v2.cjs` is proven to work and includes:
- ✅ MongoDB connectivity
- ✅ Authentication system  
- ✅ File transfer functionality
- ✅ All your accessibility features will work

This is the fastest path to deployment without SSH hassles.
