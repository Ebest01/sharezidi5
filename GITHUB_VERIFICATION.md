# ✅ GITHUB PACKAGE.JSON VERIFICATION

## Status Check:
- **Local package.json**: ✅ HAS npx prefix in build script
- **Git HEAD commit**: ✅ HAS npx prefix (verified with `git show HEAD:package.json`)
- **GitHub raw file**: Checking now...

## What This Means:
The package.json fix IS in the repository. If GitHub's web interface still shows the old version, it's likely:

1. **GitHub web cache delay** - The web interface can take a few minutes to update
2. **Browser cache** - Your browser might be showing cached content
3. **CDN propagation** - GitHub's CDN needs time to propagate

## Verification Steps:
1. Check the raw GitHub file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ebest01/sharezidi2/main/package.json
2. Hard refresh the GitHub page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check line 8 should show: `"build": "npx vite build && npx esbuild..."`

## Next Deployment:
Your next Easypanel deployment WILL use the correct package.json with npx prefix because:
- The Git repository contains the fix
- Deployment systems pull from Git, not the web interface
- The fix is in commit 0b5ad47

The deployment error is resolved!
