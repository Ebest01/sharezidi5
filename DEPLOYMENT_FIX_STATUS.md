# üö® DEPLOYMENT FIX STATUS - URGENT

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ **Local package.json**: Fixed with `npx vite build && npx esbuild...`
- ‚ùå **GitHub repository**: Still shows old version without `npx`
- ‚úÖ **Production container**: Fixed via SSH with `npx` prefix

## The Problem:
The GitHub repository package.json still shows:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/prod-server.ts..."
```

But it needs to show:
```json
"build": "npx vite build && npx esbuild server/prod-server.ts..."
```

## Immediate Action Required:
You need to manually edit the package.json file directly on GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Ebest01/sharezidi2/blob/main/package.json
2. Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
3. Change line 8 from: `"build": "vite build && esbuild`
4. To: `"build": "npx vite build && npx esbuild`
5. Commit the change with message: "Fix build script: Add npx prefix for deployment"

## Why This Is Critical:
- The Git lock issues are preventing automatic push
- Production deployments pull from GitHub, not local files
- Without this fix, future deployments will fail with "vite: not found"

## Alternative Solutions:
1. Wait for Git lock to clear and try push again
2. Edit directly on GitHub (recommended)
3. Clone fresh repository and apply fix

**Current Priority: Get the npx fix into GitHub repository**
