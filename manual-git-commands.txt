Manual Git Commands to Fix MongoDB Production Issue:

1. First, run these commands in your terminal:
   git add prod-server-v2.js
   git commit -m "Replace bundled server with CommonJS prod-server-v2.js - fix MongoDB ESM bundling error"
   git push origin main

2. The prod-server-v2.js file is ready and contains:
   - CommonJS require() instead of ESM bundling
   - All file transfer functionality preserved
   - Complete authentication system
   - MongoDB integration without bundling conflicts
   - Fixed "Dynamic require of stream" error

3. This will update the GitHub repository and trigger EasyPanel deployment automatically.

The CommonJS approach completely avoids the ESM bundling issue that was causing the MongoDB error.
