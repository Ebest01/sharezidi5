Manual Git Commands to Fix MongoDB Production Issue:

CRITICAL: You need to update TWO files in the GitHub repository:

1. First, update package.json and change line 9 from:
   "start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/prod-server.js",
   TO:
   "start": "NODE_ENV=production node prod-server-v2.js",

2. Then run these commands in your terminal:
   git add prod-server-v2.js package.json
   git commit -m "Replace bundled server with CommonJS prod-server-v2.js - fix MongoDB ESM bundling error"
   git push origin main

The prod-server-v2.js file is ready and contains:
- CommonJS require() instead of ESM bundling
- All file transfer functionality preserved
- Complete authentication system
- MongoDB integration without bundling conflicts
- Fixed "Dynamic require of stream" error

IMPORTANT: Both files (prod-server-v2.js AND updated package.json) must be committed together or EasyPanel will still try to use the old bundled server.

The CommonJS approach completely avoids the ESM bundling issue that was causing the MongoDB error.
