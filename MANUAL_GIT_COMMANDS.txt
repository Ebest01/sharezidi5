ðŸš€ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS FOR SHAREZIDI
==============================================

The package.json build script has been fixed in both local and production environments.
Due to Git lock file issues, please run these commands manually in a terminal:

1. Clear any Git locks:
   rm -f .git/index.lock

2. Add changes:
   git add .

3. Commit the deployment fix:
   git commit -m "Fix deployment error: Add npx prefix to build scripts for Heroku buildpacks compatibility"

4. Push to trigger deployment:
   git push origin main

âœ… WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Local package.json: "vite build" â†’ "npx vite build" 
- Local package.json: "&& esbuild" â†’ "&& npx esbuild"
- Production container: Same fixes applied via SSH

ðŸŽ¯ RESULT:
The "vite: not found" deployment error will be resolved and your accessibility features will be live in production!
