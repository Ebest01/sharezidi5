# ShareZidi - Real-time File Transfer Application

## Overview

ShareZidi is a real-time peer-to-peer file sharing application built with React frontend and Express backend, utilizing WebSocket connections for instant file transfers between devices. The application features advanced chunk-based file transfer with synchronization monitoring, error recovery, and optimized performance based on network conditions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom hooks for WebSocket and file transfer logic
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with ES modules
- **WebSocket**: ws library for real-time communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (schema defined but minimal usage)
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Migrations**: Managed through drizzle-kit

## Key Components

### WebSocket Communication (`FileTransferService`)
- Manages connected users and active file transfers
- Handles chunked file transfer with progress tracking
- Implements connection cleanup and error recovery
- Supports transfer synchronization monitoring

### File Transfer System
- **Chunk-based Transfer**: Files split into optimized chunks based on size and network conditions
- **Parallel Streams**: Multiple concurrent chunk transfers for improved speed
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress monitoring for both sender and receiver
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic for failed chunks and network issues
- **Sync Monitoring**: Tracks sender/receiver synchronization with duplicate chunk detection

### Frontend Components
- **ShareZidiApp**: Main application container
- **FileSelector**: Drag-and-drop file selection with preview
- **DeviceList**: Shows available devices for file sharing
- **TransferSyncMonitor**: Real-time transfer progress and synchronization status
- **ErrorRecoveryPanel**: Handles transfer issues and recovery options

### Custom Hooks
- **useWebSocket**: Manages WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect
- **useFileTransfer**: Handles file selection, transfer logic, and progress tracking
- **useIsMobile**: Responsive design detection

## Data Flow

1. **Connection**: Users connect via WebSocket and register with unique IDs
2. **Discovery**: Connected devices are broadcast to all users
3. **File Selection**: Users select files through drag-and-drop or file picker
4. **Transfer Initiation**: Sender requests transfer to target device
5. **Chunk Processing**: Files are split into optimized chunks and sent in parallel
6. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of sent/received chunks with sync status
7. **Error Handling**: Automatic retry and recovery for failed transfers
8. **Completion**: Files are reassembled on receiver side

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: @radix-ui components, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express, ws (WebSocket), Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless, PostgreSQL driver
- **Development**: Vite, ESBuild, TSX for development server

### Optional Features
- **Authentication**: Basic user registration (minimal implementation)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session management
- **File Compression**: Infrastructure for ZIP functionality (not fully implemented)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Server**: TSX with hot reloading
- **Client**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations with `npm run db:push`

### Production
- **Build**: `npm run build` - compiles both frontend and backend
- **Server**: Node.js with compiled JavaScript
- **Frontend**: Static files served by Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Required for PostgreSQL connection
- **PORT**: Server port (defaults to 5000)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment detection for development/production features

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Technical approach: Use highest level of programming logic and reasoning. Focus on efficient, intelligent solutions rather than complex trial-and-error approaches. Minimize back-and-forth by thinking through problems systematically before implementing.
