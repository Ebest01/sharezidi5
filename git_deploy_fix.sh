- Moved vite from devDependencies to dependencies
- Moved esbuild, typescript, tailwindcss to dependencies  
- Moved @vitejs/plugin-react to dependencies
- Moved autoprefixer, postcss to dependencies
- Moved @tailwindcss/vite to dependencies
- Moved Replit plugins to dependencies

This fixes 'vite: not found' deployment errors on Heroku/Easypanel
which only install dependencies (not devDependencies) in production.

Build script already has npx prefix: 
'npx vite build && npx esbuild...'

Configuration matches successfully deployed version."
