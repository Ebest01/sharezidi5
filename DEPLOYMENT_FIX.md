# ShareZidi Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Identified
During deployment on Easypanel/Heroku buildpacks, the build fails with:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

This happens because the build script in package.json calls `vite` directly instead of `npx vite`.

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Build Script
Run the build-fix.sh script locally:
```bash
chmod +x build-fix.sh
./build-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Update Build Script (Requires Package.json Edit)
Change the build script from:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/prod-server.ts..."
```
To:
```json
"build": "npx vite build && npx esbuild server/prod-server.ts..."
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Production Server
The existing `prod-server-v2.cjs` uses CommonJS and avoids build issues:
```json
"start": "node prod-server-v2.cjs"
```

## Current Status
✅ Accessibility features fully implemented and working in development
✅ Authentication system working with test credentials
✅ File transfer system operational
❌ Production deployment blocked by build script issue

## Next Steps
1. Fix package.json build script with npx prefix
2. Re-deploy to production 
3. Test accessibility features in production environment
4. Verify all functionality works after deployment
