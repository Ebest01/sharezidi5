# ShareZidi4 Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
Easypanel Docker daemon is experiencing infrastructure issues:
- Build process completes successfully 
- Export fails with "unexpected EOF" during image saving
- This is not a code issue - it's Easypanel infrastructure

## Solution: Create Fresh Repository

### Step 1: Create sharezidi4 Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create new repository: `sharezidi4`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we'll push existing code)

### Step 2: Push Working Code to sharezidi4
```bash
# Remove old remote and add new one
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/sharezidi4.git

# Push all working code
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create New Easypanel Service
1. Go to Easypanel dashboard
2. Create new service: `sharezidi_v4` 
3. Source: GitHub repository `sharezidi4`
4. Build method: **Buildpacks** (not Docker)
5. Start command: `node start.js`

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Set these in Easypanel:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://shzmdb2:11xxshzMDB@193.203.165.217:27017/sharezidi?authSource=admin&ssl=false`

## Working Configuration
- **Server**: Uses tsx to run TypeScript directly (same as development)
- **Frontend**: Built with Vite (standard React build)
- **Database**: MongoDB with BCrypt authentication
- **Authentication**: userh5nu9u@gmail.com / BCB319384xh
- **Features**: File transfers, WebSocket, geolocation, accessibility

## Why This Should Work
- Fresh repository eliminates any deployment history issues
- Same working code that runs perfectly in development
- Buildpacks instead of Docker avoids daemon issues
- Simple Node.js starter script for maximum compatibility

The code is ready - it's just the Easypanel Docker infrastructure causing the problem.
